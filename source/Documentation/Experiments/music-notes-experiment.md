# Sequence Learning - "Music Notes Experiment"

Author: Damir Dobric

## Introduction
To demonstrate learning of sequences, I have originally developed an experiment to learn the song. In this experiment the input is defined a set of music notes.
Every music note is represented as a scalar value, which appear in the sequence of notes. For example, notes C, D, E, F, G and H can be associated with the scalar values: C-0, D-1, E-2, F-3, G-4, H-5. By following that rule notes of some has been taken. In the very first experiment the song *twinkle, twinkle little star* was used in the experiment:

Over time, the experiment has grown, but we have kept the original name '*Music Notes Experiment*'. In this experiment various outputs are generated, which trace the state of active columns and active cells during the learning process. Today, we use this experiment to learn how HTM learns sequences.
