# SDR representation as text

The generated SDRs can be represented in the form of text. In the text representation the indexes where the SDRs are "1" is printed.
Text representation is done using the following statement:

```cs
Debug.WriteLine(NeoCortexApi.Helpers.StringifyVector(ArrayUtils.IndexWhere(result, k => k == 1)));
```

# SDR generation using Spatial pooler with representation in heatmap

The spatial pooler learns feed-forward connections between input bits and columns. All the steps (learning the connections to each column from a subset of the inputs,
determining the level of input to each column, and using inhibition to select a sparse set of active columns) are referred to as the “spatial pooler”.
Encoding in spatial pooler can be done by various encoders for example Scalar encoder if scalar values are fed. SDRs are generated via encoders in this case.

## SDR generation using Image as Input

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74201563/113511731-ac4c9b00-9561-11eb-8d9d-5dc99a401453.png" width="450"><br />

Cases where Image is taken as input, an Image Binarize function from the library “LearningFoundation.ImageBinarizer” which binarizes the image and presents the image in the
form of a 2D array with 0’s and 1’s. The “BinarizeImage” function takes 3 parameters – the input image, the size in which the 2D array will be represented (here for example 28x28)
and in the name of the text file after its converted to a 2D array. It creates a text file to show the representation as below along with the code snippet.

```cs
public static string BinarizeImage(string mnistImage, int imageSize, string testName)
{
string binaryImage;

Binarizer imageBinarizer = new Binarizer(200, 200, 200, imageSize, imageSize);
binaryImage = $"{testName}.txt";
if (File.Exists(binaryImage))
File.Delete(binaryImage);

imageBinarizer.CreateBinary(mnistImage, binaryImage);

return binaryImage;
}
```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74201563/113514065-d9527b00-956c-11eb-9399-a93a13888a08.png" width="450"><br />

The text file generated is converted to a vector with the help of function ReadCsvInteger. It takes the Binary File Image as the input parameter.
Spatial Pooler uses this input vector as the “input space” and generates the active array which is the SDR.

The function used to compute the active array is
 ```cs
spatialPooler.compute(inputVector, activeArray, true);
```
This function takes 3 arguments, the input vector which would be used to convert into an activeArray(2nd parameter) with learning value(3rd parameter) set to true.
In the process, spatial pooler also provides us with “Active columns” where the columns are indexed by the function.

```cs
var activeCols = ArrayUtils.IndexWhere(activeArray, (el) => el == 1);
```
The activeArray computed by the spatial pooler is then converted to a 2-dimentional array with the help of “ArrayUtils”.
In this case the dimensions are set to be 64x64. The 2D array can be further transposed and used as an input parameter for Bitmap function.


## Usecase representing an Alphabet L in Heatmap after computing in spatial pooler

```cs
overlapArrays.Add(ArrayUtils.Make2DArray<double>(ArrayUtils.ToDoubleArray(connections.Overlaps), colDims[0], colDims[1]));
```
This function generates a heatmap to represent the overlap array and keeps a count of the hits on each position of the array for every cycle till the stable state is reached.
In case of the Image for Alphabet L, the cycle takes 153 round to obtain stability. Within this process, the “overlapArrays” record the count of each position.
To represent this in the form of heatmap, the function “DrawHeatmaps()” of NeoCortexUtils which indirectly uses bitmap takes 7 parameters.

```cs
NeoCortexUtils.DrawHeatmaps(overlapArrays, $"{outputImage}_overlap.png", 1024, 1024, 150, 50, 5);
```

## Parameter Info
-	overlapArray contains the count of each position, the active array positions are hit in each cycle.
-	The output overlap heatmap representation in png format.
-	Width of the heatmap
-	Height of the heatmap
-	To set the pixel color next 3 parameters are used:
  ```cs
  decimal redStart = 200, decimal yellowMiddle = 127, decimal greenStart = 20
  ```
  1.	redstart: the value is 200 by default, Values higher than this value is red and lower than this value turns yellow.
  2.	yellowMiddle: this represents the middle of the heat. Higher than the set value turns red and lower to green.
  3.	greenstart: 20 by default, value below this value is green and higher the value turns yellow.


With the help of below code snippet, the pixel color is set based on the heat or intensity which is referred to the count of each position in the array here.

```cs
myBitmap.SetPixel(n * (bmpWidth / twoDimArrays.Count) + Xcount * scale + padX, Ycount * scale + padY, GetColor(redStart, yellowMiddle, greenStart, (Decimal)arr[Xcount, Ycount]));
```

Below are 3 columns showing the active array, active columns and the intensity or the count of each position in the array hit with the number of cycles used for learning in spatial pooler.

It can be noticed that most of the intensity/count values are withing the range of  5- 50, so the heatmap corresponds to green and yellow color which are set to the pixels.

The final representation of heatmap for the Overlap array is as below:
